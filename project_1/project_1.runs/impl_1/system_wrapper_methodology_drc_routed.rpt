2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-2#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock system_i/util_ds_buf_1/U0/IBUF_OUT[1] is created on an inappropriate pin system_i/util_ds_buf_1/U0/IBUF_OUT[0]. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-2#2 Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock system_i/util_ds_buf_1/U0/IBUF_OUT[1] is created on an inappropriate pin system_i/util_ds_buf_1/U0/IBUF_OUT[1]. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock system_i/util_ds_buf_1/U0/IBUF_OUT[1] is defined downstream of clock rx_clk and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led_o[0] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led_o[1] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led_o[2] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led_o[3] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led_o[4] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led_o[5] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0

An output delay is missing on led_o[6] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#8 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led_o[7] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

XDCB-2#1 Warning
Clock defined on multiple objects  
The clock daisy_n_o[1] is defined on multiple objects. Although this is logically functional for timing analysis, it cannot exist in hardware. It is recommended to define a primary clock on a single object.

XDCB-2#2 Warning
Clock defined on multiple objects  
The clock daisy_p_o[1] is defined on multiple objects. Although this is logically functional for timing analysis, it cannot exist in hardware. It is recommended to define a primary clock on a single object.

create_clock constraint set on both sides of diff pair port  
Two clock definitions daisy_p_o[1] and daisy_n_o[1] found on differential ports daisy_p_o[0] and daisy_n_o[0]. It is recommended to only create a clock on port P.
